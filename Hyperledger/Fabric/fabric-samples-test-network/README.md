These are some scripts and hints on getting the Hyperledger Fabric fabric-samples test-network setup on an Ubuntu system.

This uses the repo: https://github.com/kurtseifried/fabric-samples for the scipts

This uses the repo: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples for the binaries

And a slight fork of the script: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/scripts/bootstrap.sh (it uses my repo for the scripts).
